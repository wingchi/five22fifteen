        <h2>Boston Public Garden - George Robert White Memorial</h2>
        <iframe width="100%" height="250" frameborder="0" style="border:0" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?q=George%20Robert%20White%20Memorial%2C%20Boston%2C%20MA&key=AIzaSyC5olwk6VhlhQhxTcMPD5xihwbA3gLz4i0"></iframe>
        <h3>Ceremony</h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ceremony is to take place in the beautiful Boston Public Garden at three o'clock in the afternoon on Friday, May 22nd. It will last approximately thirty minutes, with another thirty minutes for socializing and visiting. Keep in mind that there will be no seating available in the garden. 
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please gather near the George Robert White Memorial at northwest corner of the park. There will be no signs or decorations to direct you (as mandated by the City of Boston), but we will try to position ushers near the corner of Arlington Street and Beacon Street to guide you into the park.
        </p>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>

          We strongly recommend parking at a T station and taking a train into the city. This will be significantly more affordable for those of you traveling from out of town. If you choose to park at a station, make sure to plan for about a 30-45 minute ride and a 5 minute walk.
