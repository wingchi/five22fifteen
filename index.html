        <h1>Important Update</h1>
        <h2>Our dearest friends and family,</h2>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent months, the plan for the celebration of our marriage has taken many twists and turns.  To our great distress, it began evolving into something neither of us believed to be representative of us. This is why, after a great deal of serious consideration, we have decided to wipe the slate clean and recreate our wedding from the ground up. This means some big changes for you, our dear guests.
        </p>

        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dispell some of your concerns, we are still having a ceremony, and it will still be on May 22, 2015. However, there will be no reception to follow immediately after. If you still wish to celebrate the occasion with us with this change in mind, please read on.
        </p>

        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ceremony is to take place in the beautiful Boston Public Garden at three o'clock in the afternoon, Friday, May 22nd. It will last approximately thirty minutes, with another thirty minutes for socializing and visiting. Keep in mind that there will be no seating available in the garden. Please check out our <a href="">location</a> page for more info on the venue, lodging, and commute.
        </p>

        <h3>"Wait, but I wanted a party!"</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear not, we have you covered! While we still intend to plan a reception sometime in the future, there are some parties happening before the big day that can tide you over:

That being said, we hope to see you all soon!
